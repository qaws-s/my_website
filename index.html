      <h1>Hello! I'm Yasser Alhathlool</h1>
      <h2>And I am...</h2>
      <p>
        <p>
  A high school student with a strong passion for <strong>mechanical engineering</strong>, <strong>coding</strong>, and <strong>computer science</strong>, driven by a deep curiosity about how things work—especially cars. I've gained hands-on experience through <strong>projects</strong>, <strong>competitions</strong>, and constant learning in both <strong>engineering</strong> and <strong>tech</strong>. I was part of a competitive team focused on <strong>automotive performance</strong>, and I stay active both mentally and physically through hobbies like <strong>boxing</strong>. I'm always excited to connect with others who share an interest in <strong>engineering</strong>, <strong>racing</strong>, <strong>coding</strong>, and <strong>building meaningful things</strong>.

      <h2>An aspiring mechanical engineer</h2>
      <p>
        I love <strong>problem-solving</strong> in <strong>mechanical engineering</strong> and enjoy turning ideas into real-world designs. I have experience working on <strong>cars</strong>, using <strong>AutoCAD</strong> and <strong>Fusion 360</strong>, and doing <strong>3D design</strong> in general. I've worked with <strong>aerodynamic CFD simulations</strong>, <strong>blueprinting</strong>, and <strong>3D printing</strong>—skills that have helped me explore <strong>engineering</strong> from concept to creation.
